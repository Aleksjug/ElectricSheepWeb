# About The Project

WebGL Build for ElectricSheep, repoistory link is [here](https://github.com/Aleksjug/ElectricSheep)

Electric Sheep is a 2D top-down dungeon crawler with procedurally generated levels and a unique resource mechanic. Your mission is to thwart the evil machinations of MainFrame, the ruler of this pocket of cyberspace. You can approach your mission with straightforward firepower, or with speed. No matter which you choose, your charge level is what keeps you alive and what powers your shots. Fortunately, it seems that activating new rooms recharges your energy, and terminated processes leave some of their energy behind. Will you persevere to the final showdown with MainFrame? How will your choices affect your destiny? Find out in Electric Sheep!
